# Auto-CLICKER
so i saw that there aren't any good auto clickers out there so i made this one from python and you just click the ` button under esc to start clicking and pressing it again stops it

you can now complie it yourself by downloading my Auto Clicker.py file downloading python
making sure to check add python.exe to PATH making sure that pip is selected than
running pip install pyinstaller
and pip install keyboard
and pip install pynput
than finally run pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole "C:\path\to\your\Auto Clicker.py"
than checking where it dropped the exe file and running it
