# Auto-CLICKER
so i saw that there aren't any good auto clickers out there so i made this one from python and you just click the ` button under esc to start clicking and pressing it again stops it


you can now also complie it yourself using the Auto Clicker.py file downloading python and running pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole "C:\path\to\your\Auto Clicker.py"

also now the file wont need admin privileges
